# BugMaster
Bug tracking tool
The is still a rough attempt at a bug tracking tool. This project utilises the following:
-Entity framework 
-.Net3.0 core 
-CSS 
-MVC 

The road map for this project is to add the following functionality: 
A landing page where a user can login or register (completed) 
The ability to register a user and login securely (completed except for styling) 
The ability for the user to create a bug with the following information: 
Short description, Steps to recreate, expected vs actual results, supporting documentation, assigned to. (completed) 
The ability to search for bugs based on the following criteria: ID; Short description; assigned to; created by (completed).
A user homepage displaying their stats like how many bugs the user has been assigned to etc (not started) 
A work flow to manage the active bugs
